Machine_Learning_For_Network_Interface

Employs data collection from a Cisco ASA using this script:
https://github.com/allend2092/Cisco_Network_Automation/blob/master/collect_stats_from_asa.py

This is a project I started to better understand statistics and machine learning. I want to track the packet throughput of my home firewall and use statistics and machine learning to learn if there are usage patterens in the data. Ultimately, if a pattern exists, I'd like to create a model that can predict the packet input and packet output for a future time and date. 

Hoping this works out!
